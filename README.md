iOS Test Task

Here is a little demo of app usage:

This is my very first solid experience in Swift
More than that, it is my first experience in Storyboards, as I started to learn iOS development from SwiftUI
Please pay attention that SerpApi has api-key free limit of 100 usages/month. I took about 50 of them. API Key set in code (searchLogic.swift).
I am not saying that app works perfectly, since there is a lot of things I might've improved, but I literally do not know how to figure it to a google query.
The app caches images (thumbnails from collectionview) in Core Data, as it caches fullscreen images (originals).
I tried to comment as much code as I could.

Best wishes
